		<h4>About the Wheel of Time&reg; Database</h4>
		<p>Welcome! Thank you so much for your interest in this website.  I strive to create an enjoyable user experience and a fast, accurate way to search and find all of your Wheel of Time&reg; needs!</p>
		<h4>Message from a Hard-Core Fan Freak</h4>
		<p>If you're an avid reader of the Wheel of Time&reg;, you must know that there are over a thousand characters with dozens of nationalities, classes and factions.  And you also know that when a new book comes out, it's imperative that we re-read all of the prior books to catch up -- after all, very few of us (if any) can remember it all!  However, I found myself reading through book 7 or book 8, and I saw a name -- I forget which one -- and I thought to myself, "Who the heck is that?"</p>
		<p>I searched around the internet and found some fantastic resources such as <a href="http://www.encyclopaedia-wot.org" target="_blank">Encyclopaedia WoT</a>, <a href="http://www.dragonmount.com" target="_blank">Dragonmount</a> and many other resources.  It took about twenty clicks, but I found what I was looking for (and then some).  The only thing that bugged me was the lack of a true, centralized, searchable database.  I wanted a way to find out information about characters quickly and accurately.</p>
		<p>And thus the site was born.</p>
		<p>I compiled all the data I could find into a mySQL database.  This kind of database is known as a relational database, which essentially means that I can cross-reference data pretty quickly.  In other words, nearly every single page on this website (with the exception of this one and the Contact page) is generated on the fly from a database.</p>
		<p>Why is this important?  Well, first of all, it allows for simple changes to the website without altering the data.  Second, it allows me to update the data in one place and then the change propagates across the entire website.  And finally, it allowed me to build a search engine to crawl through this massive amount of data (over 1400 characters!) to find whatever it is I'm searching for.  The engine isn't perfect, but I'm continually tweaking it to be better and better.</p>
		<p>So why should you come here instead of Encyclopaedia WoT or Dragonmount?  Well, I'll be honest with you: you shouldn't.  This site is for a specific purpose: finding character-related data quickly and accurately.  Personally, I visit both of those sites on a pretty regular basis, even with WoTDB up and running.  I intend is for this to be a complement of the others, an accessory to improving the vast knowledge of the Wheel of Time&reg;.</p>
		<p>What I want you, the user, to get out of this site is the ability to find answers to questions that you don't already know.  Need an example? Ask yourself this:  How many dead soldiers are there?  Go ahead.  Think about it for a second.  I'll wait.</p>
		<p>No idea?  Fifty, maybe? A hundred?  Well, a quick search at the top of the page for "dead soldier" will spit out the results.  Pretty neat, huh?</p>
		<p>Now try and find that same information anywhere else.  Go ahead.  I'm not going anywhere.</p>
		<p>Not so easy, is it?  While the other sites do contain that kind of data, the Wheel of Time&reg; Database is here to quickly bring you what you're looking for.  You can think of WoTDB as your own Wheel of Time&reg; Personal Assistant.  It does all the hard work, and you reap the rewards.</p>
		<p>If you're looking for something very specific -- a particular character, place, faction, or interview -- or even things like blogs, community forums and conventions, then perhaps Encyclopaedia WoT, Dragonmount, the WoTFAQ or any number of other resources would be better suited to your needs.  But if you want a broader view of things or a very specific slice of the entire pie, then the Wheel of Time&reg; Database is for you.</p>
		<p>I hope you enjoy the Wheel of Time&reg; Database.  This site is the culmination of months of effort and I sincerely hope you find it useful.  As always, I accept comments, suggestions and corrections from the <a href="/contact">Contact page</a>.</p>
		<p>Regards,</p>
